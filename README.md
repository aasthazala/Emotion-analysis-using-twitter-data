# Sentimental-analysis-using-twitter-data


Human emotion detection plays a vital role in the interpersonal relationships. 
Emotional community detection provides in-depth knowledge of people’s 
behaviour. Community detection and sentiment analysis are two such 
instances, which is very much popular for the investigation and understanding 
of social networks. People’s decisions as well as their social relationships can 
be affected and shaped by crowds in social networks, and since public opinion 
and emotions are important to all aspects of human lives, their recognition is 
quite important.

This project will describe user’s actions and influence in Social networks.
This is a new project from my side but previously many people worked on 
this topic. The people who are keen interested in social network especially in 
sentimental analysis will find my work useful.
This approach will be used for numerous area. For instance, companies can 
able to understand about people’s view on their products. In addition, it will 
help to understand how people react to world wide happenings.

First we identify network, then collect datasets using Twitter API, find 
different methods. After that analyse the collected data.
This project will use Ekman’s emotional scale: fear, anger, joy, sadness, 
disgust, and surprise. Moreover, some methods will be used which is proposed 
in previous work
